## About
I started this project to a college work in UDF realizing the need for bicycle rentals. It's a React Native project made with Expo and Firebase.

## Running
- Make a firebase project named Bicicletas
- Create a file in `src/config/firebase.js` with your firebase configs, like this

- `cd mobile`
- `npm install`
- `npm start`
- Enjoy!
